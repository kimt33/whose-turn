* Randomly select an object by weighing the probability by some attribute. 
E.g. select who is going a present at the next group meeting, what movie to watch in next movie event.

##Idea:
* Let there be N objects
* Select N numbers {p_i} using uniform distribution in [0,1). Let these numbers add up to M
* Note that this number M, is uniformly distributed in [0,N).
* Also, p_i is uniformly distributed in [0,M)
* So without any weights, over a long period, all p_i should have the same probability of occuring.
* Now, we should be able to affect these probabilities by weighing the probability of each one with a coefficient. Since all the numbers were randomly generated, the weighed probability should still be random (except it's no longer uniform).

```
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum_i p_i &= 1\\
\sum_i w_i p_i &= 1+\sum_j(w_j-1)p_j \mbox{ where $w_i>=0$}\\
\frac{\sum_i w_i p_i}{1+\sum_j(w_j-1)p_j} &= 1\\
\frac{\sum_i w_i p_i}{\sum_j w_j p_j} = &1\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```

* Now if we wanted to increase/decrease the i'th probability by factor $k_i$, then 

```
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{w_i}{\sum_j w_j p_j} &= k_i\\
w_i &= k_i \sum_j w_j p_j\\
0 &= (k_i p_i-1)w_i + \sum_{j\neq i}  k_i p_j w_j
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```

* Note that this is a linear system, and if we wanted to find weights such that all the probability is change by a factor of $\vec{k}$, we create a linear system and solve for $\vec{w}$
* Also note that I am lazy and have yet to implement this. Right now, we set the $\vec{w}$ directly instead of solving for it from $\vec{k}$.

* But the general idea is that we can change the distribution, quite simply, by weighing them then renormalizing.

##Group Meeting:
* Each member is weighed by the number of weeks since their last presentation, where the weight is set to zero if number of weeks is less than 3.
* The person with the largest number is selected to be the person to present on a given date.
* The information on each presentation is stored by pickling the GroupMeetings instance in group_meeting.py of ./groupmeeting. 
* We'd need to store and accesss this each time we assign. There's not that much information to store, so this shouldn't get too crazy heavy.
* Github is used for transparency: if you think the weighing is unfair, feel free to modify, but we'd know exactly who modified it and how it was modified.
